## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character discovers a 'sacred' artifact of a counter-culture is a deliberate, lucrative forgery they helped create.
- A rival 'curator' opens a club across from The Bardo, selling a more authentic, raw, and dangerous experience. Describe the first night.
- Mina's origin story: how did she go from a true believer to the 'architect of acquisition'?
- The Prophet outside The Bardo gets a better offer. Write his resignation speech to Cassius.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Relic Authentication' simulator that generates procedurally detailed descriptions of fake beat-generation artifacts, complete with fabricated provenance chains and spectral analysis reports.
- Create a dynamic, neon-noir CSS theme generator for a website based on the novel's aesthetic, using variables for 'syrupy vermilion', 'electric cyan', and 'jellyfish pulse'.

## Origin

Generated through persona500's Council-Prism Generation.
SASI evaluation: 8/10

Council: William S. Burroughs (cold, cut-up analysis of power systems), Patricia Highsmith (elegant suspense and amoral aesthetics), Don DeLillo (theology of consumerism and curated reality), Neon Noir Cinematography (as a conceptual legend: the visual language of moral decay in saturated color)
